Video Outline:

1. Introduction: The Beginning of COP (1995)

Visual: A large, colorful calendar showing "COP1 – 1995" highlighted, with a globe slowly rotating in the background.

Narrator: "This is where it all started, back in 1995, when world leaders gathered for the first Conference of the Parties, or COP. The goal? To work together and stop the planet from getting too hot."

Key message repeated: "We agreed to keep the Earth from warming too much."



2. Early Climate Targets: COP1 to COP10

Visual: Simple, easy-to-read graphs showing rising global temperatures and small, bold text summarizing key goals.

Narrator: "In the early years, we set targets to reduce the greenhouse gases causing the Earth to warm. The goal was to keep the warming below 2 degrees Celsius."

Cause of failure: "But we sometimes forgot these targets, or didn’t follow through, because they were hard to keep up with. The plans were too big and complicated."

Visual aid: Gentle red arrows indicating plans were "lost" or "forgotten."



3. Key Turning Points: COP15 (Copenhagen) and COP21 (Paris Agreement)

Visual: Video clips of world leaders shaking hands in Copenhagen (COP15) and Paris (COP21), smiling, agreeing on climate action. Followed by a simple chart showing a 1.5°C goal.

Narrator: "In Copenhagen, 2009, and Paris, 2015, we came together again. This time, we promised not just to limit warming to 2 degrees but to aim for 1.5 degrees."

Cause of failure: "We made big promises, but as time went on, we lost focus. Sometimes the plans were unrealistic, or we just couldn't remember all the details."



4. Progress vs. Forgetfulness: COP22 to COP29

Visual: A series of rapidly changing headlines showing fluctuating promises, missed goals, and unclear outcomes from recent summits.

Narrator: "From COP22 onward, we kept setting goals. But something kept happening. We didn't stick to them. Some plans were too hard, others got delayed, and sometimes... we just forgot about them."

Visual: A memory bubble with "We forgot" and a sad emoji, contrasting with "We promised" and a happy emoji.



5. Unrealistic Expectations: Why Plans Failed

Visual: A simple animation showing leaders pushing a large rock labeled "Emissions Reductions" uphill, only for it to roll back down.

Narrator: "We tried to do too much too quickly. The plans were too big. Leaders got confused, overwhelmed, or couldn’t remember everything. So, the rock of climate action kept rolling backward."

Cause of failure: "Plans were made to cut emissions too fast or too drastically without clear, simple steps. And without reminders, we lost track of what to do next."



6. The 1.5°C Target: Exceeding It in Just One Year

Visual: A thermometer quickly rising to 1.5°C and then overshooting to 2°C.

Narrator: "Because we didn't stick to our plans, the Earth is heating faster than we thought. Instead of keeping to the 1.5°C limit by 2050, we’re already on track to pass it in just one year."

Cause of failure: "This is because, after so many summits, we forgot our goals, didn’t change our habits, and made plans that were too unrealistic."

Reminder: A large sign reading "Time is running out!" fades into view slowly, staying on-screen.



7. The Role of Forgetfulness: Acknowledging Our Cognitive Limits

Visual: Leaders depicted as cartoon characters, scratching their heads and looking confused as they face a mountain of paperwork.

Narrator: "Sometimes, we overestimated what we could do. With so many meetings, so many papers, and complicated plans, we got lost. We also forgot important things along the way. That’s okay. We’re human."

Visual aid: A cartoon image of a leader looking at a simple "To-Do" list, contrasted with an overwhelming "Climate Action Plan" full of tiny text.



8. Moving Forward: Simplified, Realistic Plans

Visual: Leaders being handed smaller, simpler plans (in large fonts) that they can easily carry with them.

Narrator: "Now, we understand that we need simpler plans. Plans that we can actually follow, without getting confused or forgetting what we promised. The next step is to make goals that we can remember and stick to, one step at a time."

Key message repeated: "Simple actions we can remember."



9. Conclusion: It's Not Too Late, but We Must Act Now

Visual: The Earth shown with both a thermometer at 1.5°C and a large, ticking clock.

Narrator: "We may have forgotten the details before, but now we have a chance to change. Together, with clearer, simpler steps, we can still make a difference. The future is in our hands, and it’s time to remember what’s truly important."

Reminder on screen: "One small step at a time. We can do this!"

Post-Video Recap:
After the video, leaders will be provided with simplified summaries of the key points on laminated cards, written in large, bold font. Each card will contain one key point, like:

"We agreed on 1.5°C, but we forgot."

"Plans were too big and hard to follow."

"Now we will make smaller, easier plans."


The facilitator will gently walk leaders through the cards to ensure understanding, using repetition to reinforce the message.

Closing Remark:
“As we move forward, let’s make sure we take it step by step, focusing on what we can do today. This time, let’s not forget.”
