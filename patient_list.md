Here is a list of top emitter countries' leaders, their ages, and an overview of failed or abandoned climate commitments with the respective time spans of each promise. The focus is on key promises that were either significantly delayed, scaled back, or outright abandoned, contributing to the overall failure in meeting climate goals.


---

1. China

Leader: Xi Jinping

Age: 71 (born June 15, 1953)

Failed/Abandoned Commitments:

COP21 Paris Agreement (2015): China committed to peak carbon emissions by 2030.

Failure: China has significantly expanded coal-fired power plant capacity, making it unlikely to meet the carbon peak by 2030 without drastic action.

Time Span: 2015 – ongoing


Carbon Neutrality by 2060: Xi Jinping announced China would achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.

Failure: Lack of a clear roadmap and reliance on coal contradict the commitment to decarbonize the economy.

Time Span: 2020 – ongoing




2. United States

Leader: Joe Biden

Age: 81 (born November 20, 1942)

Failed/Abandoned Commitments:

Paris Agreement Re-entry (2021): After rejoining the Paris Agreement under Biden, the U.S. committed to cut emissions by 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030.

Failure: Lack of strong federal legislation, continued reliance on fossil fuels, and pushback from states have hindered progress.

Time Span: 2021 – ongoing


Clean Power Plan (2015): Under the Obama administration, the U.S. introduced the Clean Power Plan to reduce emissions from power plants.

Failure: Repealed by the Trump administration in 2017, and Biden’s efforts to revive similar initiatives have faced strong opposition.

Time Span: 2015 – 2017 (plan scrapped)




3. India

Leader: Narendra Modi

Age: 74 (born September 17, 1950)

Failed/Abandoned Commitments:

COP26 Commitment (2021): India promised to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070 and reduce emissions intensity by 45% by 2030.

Failure: No clear implementation plan, and continued coal dependence contradict these goals. India also avoided setting an earlier carbon neutrality date.

Time Span: 2021 – ongoing


National Solar Mission (2010): India aimed to reach 100 GW of solar power capacity by 2022.

Failure: The goal was not met, with India falling short at around 60 GW by 2022.

Time Span: 2010 – 2022 (goal missed)




4. Russia

Leader: Vladimir Putin

Age: 71 (born October 7, 1952)

Failed/Abandoned Commitments:

COP21 Paris Agreement (2015): Russia ratified the Paris Agreement and committed to reducing emissions by 25-30% from 1990 levels by 2030.

Failure: Russia's lack of substantial climate action, combined with high dependence on fossil fuel exports, has made it unlikely to meet this target.

Time Span: 2015 – ongoing


Carbon Neutrality by 2060 (2021): Putin announced Russia’s goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060.

Failure: No robust plan for reducing emissions, especially given the country’s reliance on fossil fuels and the geopolitical climate.

Time Span: 2021 – ongoing




5. Japan

Leader: Fumio Kishida

Age: 67 (born July 29, 1957)

Failed/Abandoned Commitments:

Carbon Neutrality by 2050 (2020): Japan pledged to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.

Failure: Despite progress in renewable energy, Japan continues to rely on coal and natural gas, with plans to phase out coal being slow.

Time Span: 2020 – ongoing


Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction by 26% by 2030 (2015): Japan promised a 26% reduction in GHG emissions from 2013 levels by 2030.

Failure: Delayed progress in reducing emissions, and continued reliance on fossil fuels has hindered Japan’s progress.

Time Span: 2015 – ongoing




6. European Union

Leaders: Ursula von der Leyen (President of the European Commission)

Age: 65 (born October 8, 1958)

Failed/Abandoned Commitments:

EU Green Deal (2020): The EU committed to making Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.

Failure: Though the EU has made significant progress, some member states continue to rely on fossil fuels, and the pace of decarbonization has been slower than expected.

Time Span: 2020 – ongoing


Reduction of Emissions by 55% by 2030 (2020): The EU’s pledge to reduce emissions by 55% from 1990 levels by 2030.

Failure: Inconsistent implementation across member states and the energy crisis have delayed progress.

Time Span: 2020 – ongoing




7. Brazil

Leader: Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva

Age: 78 (born October 27, 1945)

Failed/Abandoned Commitments:

Amazon Deforestation Pledge (2009): Brazil pledged to significantly reduce deforestation in the Amazon by 2020.

Failure: Under President Bolsonaro (Lula's predecessor), deforestation rates increased dramatically, effectively abandoning previous commitments.

Time Span: 2009 – 2020 (failure under Bolsonaro)


Net-Zero Emissions by 2050 (2021): Brazil pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

Failure: Lack of concrete policies and the challenge of curbing deforestation hinder this goal.

Time Span: 2021 – ongoing




8. Germany

Leader: Olaf Scholz

Age: 66 (born June 14, 1958)

Failed/Abandoned Commitments:

Phase-Out of Coal by 2038 (2019): Germany committed to phasing out coal power by 2038.

Failure: Due to the energy crisis and war in Ukraine, Germany has delayed coal phase-out plans and even reopened some coal plants.

Time Span: 2019 – ongoing


Net-Zero Emissions by 2045 (2021): Germany pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2045.

Failure: Slow progress in phasing out fossil fuels and continued reliance on natural gas challenge this goal.

Time Span: 2021 – ongoing

These leaders and countries represent the world's largest carbon emitters and have made significant but often unattainable climate commitments. Many of these commitments were ambitious but lacked clear roadmaps or political will to follow through, leading to delays or outright failures in achieving them.
