Goodbyes and Departure

Delegates are provided with personalized reminder notes on their new commitments, to be reviewed daily by staff.



---

Additional Notes:

All materials will be presented in simple language, with frequent breaks to avoid cognitive fatigue.

Summaries of each session will be emailed to personal caregivers for further reinforcement.

To ensure accountability, all leaders will be assigned a climate "guardian" to help them recall their pledges.


Day 3 (Continued): Follow-Up and Consistency Strategies

12:00 PM - 1:00 PM
Lunch Break

Meals will be served in a structured environment to reduce decision fatigue, with frequent reminders to return to the session.


1:00 PM - 3:00 PM
Session 7: Continuous Reinforcement and Adaptive Strategies

Panel: "The Role of Caregivers in Climate Policy" – Dementia care specialists discuss how climate "guardians" and caregivers will work with leaders to ensure daily climate actions are remembered and implemented. Each delegate will be assigned a personal aide to remind them of key decisions and daily actions throughout the year.

Technology Demonstration: Introduction of simple technology solutions, such as voice assistants and smart home systems, to help manage energy use and send reminders for key climate actions.


3:00 PM - 3:30 PM

Ongoing Support Post-Summit:

Climate Guardianship Program: Each leader will have a dedicated "climate guardian" who will follow up weekly to ensure actions are being taken. Guardians will use memory cues, phone calls, and personal visits to ensure accountability.

Monthly Refresher Summits: Virtual meetings will be held monthly to refresh leaders on their climate actions, with simplified agendas to avoid cognitive overload.

Visual Memory Cues: Leaders will receive periodic mailings with simple visual reminders of their climate goals (e.g., fridge magnets, posters).



---

Key Takeaways for Dementia-Friendly Climate Action:

1. Simplicity: Climate goals must be broken down into achievable, daily actions that leaders can easily remember and repeat.


2. Repetition: Frequent reminders, follow-up meetings, and visual cues are essential for maintaining focus and reducing forgetfulness.


3. Support: Caregivers and climate guardians are integral to ensuring that leaders stay on track, using dementia care principles to foster accountability.


4. Small Wins: The summit will focus on realistic, small-scale wins rather than grand, long-term plans, acknowledging the cognitive limitations of the participants.



Closing Statement:
In the spirit of understanding and support, this summit will not only address the global climate crisis but also highlight how we must adapt our strategies to meet the realities of cognitive decline. By embracing dementia management techniques, leaders can still play an active, albeit simplified, role in saving the planet. Through consistent support, reminders, and small steps, we can begin to reverse the devastating effects of both climate change and forgetfulness.
